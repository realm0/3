                    <p>Our tool was evaluated by Fiocruz and ZIKAlliance [1] specialists by means of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [2, 3, 4], according to 3 constructs: Perceived Usefulness (PU), Ease of Use (EU), and Self-Predicted Future Use (SPFU).</p>
                    <p>The specialists used the tool, following a task execution protocol, and performed 15 tasks (see the video tutorial for reference: <a href="https://youtu.be/NfcdG8o0PyE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/NfcdG8o0PyE</a>). The goal was to observe their interaction with the tool, in order to test its functionalities and the integrity of the results presented by it, and collect feedback regarding its usefulness and correctness.</p>
                    <p><b>Protocol used in the evaluation</b></p>
                    <p>For each participant, there was a general presentation of the tool, through a quick tutorial explaining how to operate it. Each participant was then asked to perform a set of tasks, which involved the use of the software and a brief discussion of the results generated by it. These tasks included:</p>
					(i) selection of a co-authorship network; <br>
					(ii) creation of a session; <br>
					(iii) selection of the parameters of the local analysis; <br>
					(iv) selection of the parameters of the individual analysis; <br>
					(v) visualization of the session calculated/processed by the system; <br>
					(vi) visualization and analysis of academic impact; <br>
					(vii) visualization of the co-authorship network; <br>
					(viii) visualization of the ranking of individual metrics (e.g., viewing the individual ranking of betweenness or closeness); <br>
					(ix) selection of the dataset that contains citation names of the researchers; <br>
					(x) viewing and/or editing the selected dataset; <br>
					(xi) visualization and analysis of the social impact of a session previously calculated/processed by the system; <br>
					(xii) visualization of the geographical distribution of mentions to the disease worldwide; <br>
					(xiii) visualization of the featured names in the scenario; <br>
					(xiv) visualization of the ‘details’ tab (profile-like page) of a researcher; <br>
					(xv) Usage of the plain search engine to search for a researcher and see his social impact from a single name. <br><br>
					<p>7 researchers volunteered for this study. The volunteer researchers performed the aforementioned tasks individually. The evaluations were recorded in audio and video (with users’ consent) and via a questionnaire with 14 items, of which 6 related to PU, 6 related to EU and 2 related to SPFU. To assess the users’ perceptions we used a five-point Likert scale ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree".</p>
					<p><b>Results</b></p>
					<p>Five women and two men participated in the study, all Ph.Ds. Their age ranged from 25 to 64 years. Most of the participants work as researchers (two are professors) and work on public health. The following charts summarize these results.</p>

					<p>Regarding the questionnaire, for each question data were aggregated in sum (total points for a single question, considering all participants’ answers for that question), mean and median. Despite some difficulties on how to navigate the system, all participants succeeded to perform all 15 tasks on their computers. Overall, the tool achieved good results on the 3 constructs, especially regarding EU and SPFU, where 5, among the 7 specialists, assigned it a high score (4 to 5 on all items), except for participant P3 in question EU1, who rated the item as neutral. According to the answers, most participants found the tool useful, easy to use and would rather prefer to use it in future than other methods to find specialists and important research. The following tables and charts show the TAM evaluation results.</p>
